# Open Captions Overlay

![Sample](./sample.gif)

`Open Captions Overlay` is a service to display subtitles on broadcast programs such as `OBS` and `XSplit`.

If you use this service, the voice spoken through the microphone can be displayed as subtitles in real time on the broadcast screen.

This project was inspired by [Closed Captions for Streams](https://www.twitch.tv/ext/xxwoffr2lnpxrgpq228mawvdgxetip).
